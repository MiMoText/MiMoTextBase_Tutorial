{% include landing-page.html title_1="Welcome to MiMoTextBase" content_1="*Imagine you wanted a ranking of the most common themes in all epistolary novels in French Enlightenment novels, an overview of authors covering “sentimentalism” or a map of all narrative places. The MiMoText knowledge graph combines the linked open data paradigm with the infrastructure of a wikibase and text mining methods of data-based literary history. Using the query language SPARQL, users can query this large and growing knowledge graph about the French Enlightenment novel.*

 MiMoTextBase was built as part of the project “Mining and Modeling Text” (2019-2023). The knowledge graph on about around 2000 French Enlightenment novels stores and provides data via a SPARQL endpoint. It is implemented using a Wikibase infrastructure and integrates various data from heterogeneous sources. Note that the project is ongoing and the contents and structure of the MiMoTextBase will continually be further developed." title_2="About MiMoTextBase" content_2="Learn more about basic SPARQL-queries, how to write and modify them. Get to know some functionalities of the (embedded) MiMoTextBase-Endpoint within Getting Started, or get to know the data behind the MiMoTextBase via SPARQL.
