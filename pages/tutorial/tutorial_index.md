### **Introduction**

The aim of this tutorial is to give users, including those without any prior knowledge, an impression of our graph, our corpus of French Enlightenment novels and the potential of Linked Open Data. If you don’t know SPARQL, you can enter the [“Getting started”](https://mimotext.github.io/MiMoTextBase_Tutorial/getting_started.html)-section to get to know SPARQL. To learn more about the data within the [MiMoTextBase](http://data.mimotext.uni-trier.de/wiki/Main_Page) using SPARQL, you can enter [authors](https://mimotext.github.io/MiMoTextBase_Tutorial/authors.html), [novels](https://mimotext.github.io/MiMoTextBase_Tutorial/novels.html), [spaces](https://mimotext.github.io/MiMoTextBase_Tutorial/spaces.html) or [themes](https://mimotext.github.io/MiMoTextBase_Tutorial/themes.html). If you need more context on the project and on linked data, please read the [ABOUT MiMoTextBase](https://mimotext.github.io/MiMoTextBase_Tutorial/aboutMiMoTextBase.html) section first.

The tutorial tries to cover different aspects in three sections. Generally speaking, the level of difficulty tends to increase. At the same time, the different sections pursue different goals, which we would like to outline briefly for better orientation.
It is possible to complete only individual units of the tutorial. To support this option, we also refer to the individual sections. Our tutorial is structured in such a way that you can learn at different levels and in varying depth depending on the level of your existing knowledge.

A great benefit of SPARQL queries lies especially in the degree of flexibility with which one can combine the basic 'tripel patterns'. Therefore, there are necessarily and usefully intersections between the parts.
The tutorial also aims to explain the particularities of the Wikibase infrastructure (the underlying data model included) as well as the possibilities for exploration and visualization that result from it. We would be happy to support and encourage you to explore our graph and to formulate or adapt queries yourself.
