### **Section 3: Going further – using MiMoTextBase for research**

Here we would like to exhibit the value and potential of the knowledge graph for different research interests. We intend to address researchers who would like to get an impression of the kind of questions that could be answered with [MiMoTextBase](http://data.mimotext.uni-trier.de/wiki/Main_Page). In a first version of the tutorial, we have focused on what we consider to be two very interesting dimensions, namely developments and change over time (i.e. between 1751 and 1800) and comparing different types of sources. The comparison of our different data sources is also interesting as they are based on very different methods. For example, the manually (and humanly) annotated topic concepts of bibliographers from the 1970s can be compared with algorithm-based results from our current topic modeling. By linking different source types in our graph and making them comparable, new amounts of data for a data-based literary history can be obtained. However, the quantitative difference of course also has qualitative dimensions, which we would like to illustrate with the queries in this subsection.

We believe the tutorial is useful for Digital Humanists with an interest in linked open data (especially from Computational Literary Studies, but also all other fields, such as Digital History or Cultural Studies), but also for literary scholars or scholars interested in Book Studies, especially those interested in the Enlightenment as a period and/or the French novel or fictional prose as a genre.
