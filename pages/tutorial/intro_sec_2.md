### **Section 2: MiMoText data (authors, novels, spaces, themes)**

In this section, we would like to illustrate the dataset to users interested in our MiMoText data in general, or more specifically in the French Enlightenment novel. There are overlaps with the other parts, but this part provides an examination of queries on our key entity types or classes (authors and novels) as well as dimensions that we have focused on in two pilot projects (space, themes).
