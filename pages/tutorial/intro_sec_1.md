### **Section 1: Getting Started**

This section is intended for users with rather little or no knowledge of SPARQL and prepares them for sections 2 and 3. There are already many helpful resources that can be used to dive into SPARQL (see helpful resources -- LINK). However, every data model is different and to really work with our [MiMoTextBase](http://data.mimotext.uni-trier.de/wiki/Main_Page) you would need some knowledge of our data and of our own modeling approach as well as the specifics of the underlying Wikibase data model. We are therefore aiming to provide a SPARQL introduction that offers learning opportunities within the Wikibase infrastructure and in relation to our data. At the same time, the subsections of section 1 serve as a reference for individual functionalities, challenges and solutions in dealing with SPARQL-queries, so that it might also be helpful for people who already have some SPARQL experience to be able to go back from the other sections or to navigate specific subsections.
