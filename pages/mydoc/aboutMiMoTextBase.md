## About MiMoTextBase

*Imagine you wanted a ranking of the most common themes in all epistolary novels in French Enlightenment novels, an overview of authors covering “sentimentalism” or a map of all narrative places. The MiMoText knowledge graph combines the linked open data (LOD) paradigm with the infrastructure of a wikibase and text mining methods of data-based literary history. Using the query language SPARQL, users can query this large and growing knowledge graph about the French Enlightenment novel.* 

[MiMoTextBase](https://data.mimotext.uni-trier.de/wiki/Main_Page){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} was built as part of the project “Mining and Modeling Text” (2019-2023). The knowledge graph on about around 2000 French Enlightenment novels stores and provides data via a SPARQL endpoint. It is implemented using a Wikibase infrastructure and integrates various data from heterogeneous sources. Note that the project is ongoing and the contents and structure of the MiMoTextBase will continually be further developed. 
The purpose of this website, and especially of our tutorial, is to introduce interested students and scholars to our knowledge graph, to convey the potentials of a data-based literary history in combination with linked open data, and to promote new perspectives on the domain, the French Enlightenment novel (1750-1800). In principle, we consider our approach transferable to other humanities disciplines and domains.

The aim of the MiMoText project is to establish a knowledge graph for the humanities built up from various sources and available as linked open data. This means that it is not only freely available and can be linked to other knowledge resources of the Semantic Web, but that it also offers innovative ways to access to scientific information.
The following overview, together with our [tutorial](tutorial_index.html), is meant to familiarize users with the basics of SPARQL in order to make use of the knowledge graph.
