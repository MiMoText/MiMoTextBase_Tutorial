### **_Am I right here or Where do I start?_**{: #where_to_start}

If you are new to SPARQL, you can go through the [Tutorial](./tutorial_index.html){:target="\_blank", rel: "noopener noreferrer"}, which will give you an overview of how to write basic queries based on examples in MiMoTextBase. It’s supposed to give newbies an introduction to SPARQL; if you're looking for more advanced knowledge of SPARQL, check out these [helpful resources](#other_tutorials)<!--- {:target="\_blank", rel: "noopener noreferrer"}-->.

If you are interested in MiMoTextBase and its content on [authors](./authors.html){:target="\_blank", rel: "noopener noreferrer"}, [novels](./novels.html){:target="\_blank", rel: "noopener noreferrer"}, [spaces](./spaces.html){:target="\_blank", rel: "noopener noreferrer"} or [themes](./themes.html){:target="\_blank", rel: "noopener noreferrer"} of the French novel in 1751-1800, and you already have some SPARQL knowledge, you can focus on the later sections of the Tutorial.

Within [Going Further](./change_over_time.html){:target="\_blank", rel: "noopener noreferrer"} there are some queries on data containing overviews of items like dates of publication or themes changing over time as well as queries that compare the different sources of data in MiMoTextBase. Together with some interpretation on the outcome, these queries show the potential of initial questions on further research.

If you want more detailed information about the structure and the aims of our tutorial, you can find this in the [introduction](./tutorial_index.html){:target="\_blank", rel: "noopener noreferrer"}. For information on the infrastructure and the models behind MiMoTextBase see "Our sources" and "Our modeling approach" in [About](./aboutMiMoTextBase.html#collapseFive){:target="\_blank", rel: "noopener noreferrer"}.



### **_How to use the data for my research?_**{: #overview}
#### _Get an overview_

First, you can get an overview of the data in the MiMoTextGraph to find out which information and entities are relevant to your research interests and how to classify and interpret your query results. You have several options to do this:

The section [The MiMoText project](./aboutMiMoTextBase.html#collapseTwo) provides a summary of the project's contents and goals. A more detailed description of the project can be found in our paper Smart Modelling for Literary History (2022). For further information, we also recommend the resources listed under [References](./aboutMiMoTextBase.html#collapseEight).

The section How / Where to find the right item / right property is also helpful as it leads you to various overview lists.

#### _Writing your own queries_{: #writing_own_queries}

With the help of the [tutorial](./tutorial_index.html), you can now query the Wikibase with your own queries to obtain information on your own research questions. The simpler queries from the section Getting Started can be combined and extended to more complex search queries (cf. Spaces, Themes, Getting Further).
To do this, either call the [SPARQL endpoint](http://query.mimotext.uni-trier.de/){:target="_blank", rel: "noopener noreferrer"} directly and enter your query or use one of the examples listed in the tutorial as a starting point and modify it as desired.

#### _Export query results_{: #export_results}
To share the result of a query or save it for later recall, you can display and copy the URL. It is also possible to embed the result in your own website. You will find the functions under the menu item “Link” on the right-hand side in the bar above the result display:

![export](./images/export.png)

Furthermore, it is possible to export the visualized results as an SVG file and the tabular results in various file formats and to process them for further analyses.
