### **Get an overview**

First, you can get an overview of the data in the MiMoText graph
to find out which information and entities are relevant to your research
interests and how to classify and interpret your query results. You have several
options to do this:

1. The section [The MiMoText project](./aboutMiMoTextBase.html) provides
   a summary of the project's contents and goals. A more detailed description of
   the project can be found in our paper "Smart Modelling for Literary History"
   (2022). For further information, we also recommend the resources listed under
   [References](https://api.zotero.org/groups/2342956/collections/SV72MEVT/items?format=bib&style=chicago-fullnote-bibliography-16th-edition).
2. The FAQ [How to find the right item / right property?](./help.html) is also helpful as it leads you to various overview lists.
