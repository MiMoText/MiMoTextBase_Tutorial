### **Write your own queries**

With the help of our [Tutorial](./tutorial_index.html), you can now query the Wikibase with your own queries to obtain information on your own research questions. The simpler queries from the section [Getting Started](./getting_started.html) can be combined and extended to more complex search queries (cf. [Spaces](./spaces.html), [Themes](./themes.html), [Going Further](./change_over_time.html)).

To do this, either call the [SPARQL-Endpoint](https://query.mimotext.uni-trier.de) directly and enter your query or use one of the examples listed in the tutorial as a starting point and modify it as desired.
