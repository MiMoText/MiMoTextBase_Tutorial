Nevertheless, we cannot exclude that there might be errors and ambiguities. MiMoText assumes no responsibility for the currentness, correctness, completeness, or quality of the information contained herein.
MiMoText is not liable for material or immaterial damages or losses that are caused directly or indirectly through the use or non-use of the information presented, unless MiMoText can be charged with willful or negligent intent.
MiMoText reserves the right to change, supplement, or delete its website, in part or in whole, without prior notice, or to remove publication from the Internet temporarily or permanently.
The tutorial website of MiMoText contains direct and indirect links to external third-party websites on the content of which MiMoText has no influence. Responsibility for this external content lies with the respective provider or operator of the external website. MiMoText is not aware of any illegal or offensive content on the websites of external providers that can be accessed through our website. At the time we created links to each of these websites, we checked for possible violations of law but did not find any illegal or offensive content. If the pages of external providers for which we provide links contain illegal or offensive content, MiMoText expressly distances itself from this content and shall immediately remove the link in question as soon as we become aware of it.
